# hello-world
Tutorial repository for storing random images, ideas, data sets, pieces of code, etc.

Hey everyone! I'm Andy, a Private Tutor, and hopefully one-day Data Scientist from the North Shore of Boston.
I like reading fantasy novels, watching basically any sport (Go Giants, Yankees, Bruins, and Celtics!), doing math, and playing video games.
Some highlights of my accomplishments are running a Tough Mudder, officiating 3 weddings for people I love, and performing stand-up comedy in NYC.
Also, I have a BS and ME in Mechanical Engineering from RPI>
